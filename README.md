# Forkify Project

Hello World, it's me Achyut Pal (https://www.linkedin.com/in/achyutpal21/)

This is my JS course final project that I have learned
building from Jonas Schmedtmann (https://twitter.com/jonasschmedtman),
thanks Jonsa it's a great Js Course.

This is a modern JS app that let you find your recipes from the internet
just by one search, using the api.

This app used JS, Styling Scss, and Browser's local storge.

Thanks You.
